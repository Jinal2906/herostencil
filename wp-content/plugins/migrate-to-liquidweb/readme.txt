Currently you can only migrate a self hosted WordPress installation, the plugin does not support migrating from WordPress.com.

= 4) What happens if I run into an error after the migration is complete? =

We are always wanting to assist and help out in any way that we can. If you encounter any type of issue please use the support section of our plugin.

= 5) Do I need to leave the window open while the migration is processing? =

No, that's the beauty of this plugin. It runs on a SAAS based technology and a secure web address that runs everything in the background. Once you start the migration you can close the window at any time and come back to it later while it's still running, no need to wait for hours. You will also receive an email once the migration has completed.
